### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cyrille Chateau, looking for an internship in Swift development.

On my personnal time, I'm currently on 2 projects, Pages De Reves & Civic Hero.

PAGES DE REVES :
It's my pictures and stories books App, about the code it's quiet simple, there is no hard functions. I need to add some content to be validate by Apple Store.

Civic Hero :
This application will be a citizen application to identify problems in the street, for example a person who needs help, a street which needs to be cleaned etc...
I will use MapKit to work on this project, about the rest I will see at the moment.
